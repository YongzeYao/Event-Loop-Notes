Event Loop is a confusing enough topic to newcomers and is not often 100% understood. What makes this even confusing is, there are two buzzwords called "NodeJS Event Loop" and "JavaScript Event Loop" where the latter speaks about the event loop in the browser. This distinction leads to question such as:

- Are these two the same, similar in behavior, or different completely?
- And if different, what are the differences?
- If they are the same, why do we have disambiguation of "NodeJS event loop" and "JavaScript Event Loop" in the first place?

简短地说，**是的，它们在某些方面非常相似**。而且，**是的，它们在某些实现层面又是不同的**。所以这篇文章中，我们来讨论这方面的相关注意点。

## What exactly is an "Event Loop"?

The term "Event Loop" is a generic programming pattern. It describes a simple loop which iterates through the results of completed events, and process them. JavaScript/NodeJS event loops are no different.

当 JS 应用运行的时候，它们会出发各种各样的 events，而这些 events 会导致相应的 event handlers 被放入队列。Event Loop 会不停循环地观察这个队列并按序处理其中的 event handlers。

## "The Event Loop" - according to HTML5 Spec

HTML5 标准描述了一系列指南给浏览器厂商以实现 browsers/JavaScript 运行时以及相关的库。标准还同时给出了实现 event loop 的以及其他和 event loop 相关的 JavaScript 特性（例如 Timers）的指南。

大部分的浏览器和 JS 运行时都会为了更好的兼容性而遵守这一系列指南。However, there are situations where they slightly deviate from this single source of truth, causing interesting (and sometimes annoying) consequences.

## Client-Side vs Server-Side JavaScript

For years, JavaScript has been limited to client-side applications such as interactive web applications run on the browser.
有很多年，JS 都只能用来在客户端实现运行在浏览器的应用中实现互动网页应用。使用 NodeJS，JavaScript 也可以被用来开发服务端应用。尽管在两种应用场景中使用的是同一个编程语言，客户端应用和服务端应用有着不同的需求。

浏览器是一个沙盒环境所以浏览器端的 JavaScript 并没有服务器端 JavaScript 的一些功能，例如文件系统操作，一些网络请求等。This requires event loops in server-side JavaScript(NodeJS) to be able to cater to these additional requirements.

Both the browser and NodeJS implements an asynchronous event-driven pattern with JavaScript. 然而，浏览器环境下的事件是 user interactions on webpages（例如鼠标点击，鼠标移动，键盘事件等等），但是在 NodeJS 环境下，事件是异步的服务端操作（例如文件 I/O 请求，网络 I/O 请求等等）。由于这个需求上的差异，Chrome 和 Node 有着不同的 Event Loop 实现，尽管它们都是用 V8 JavaScript 引擎来运行 JavaScript 代码。

由于 event loop 只是一个编程模式，V8 允许我们提供了一个外部 event loop 实现和其 JavaScript 运行时工作。正是因为这个灵活度，Chrome 浏览器使用了<u>**libevent**</u>作为它的 event loop 实现，而 NodeJS 使用<u>**libuv**</u>来实现它的 event loop。因此，浏览器的 event loop 和 NodeJS 的 event loop 是基于两个不同的库实现的所以有一些不同，but they also share the similarities of the common "Event Loop" programming pattern.

## Browsers vs Node - What's different?

### Micro-tasks vs Macro-tasks differences

> 什么是微任务和宏任务？简短的来说，宏任务和微任务是异步任务的两个种类。然而，微任务比宏任务有着更高的优先级。Promise 回调就是一个微任务，而`setTimeout`回调是一个宏任务。

One of the notable differences between browsers and Node is how they prioritize microtasks and macrotasks. Though the NodeJS versions >= v11.0.0 align with the browser's behavior in terms of this aspect, NodeJS versions older than v11.0.0 have a significant difference as I've discussed in the [previous post](<./6.%20New%20Changes%20to%20the%20Timers%20and%20Microtasks%20in%20Node%20v11.0.0%20(and%20above).md>) as well.

根据 HTML5 标准针对 event loop 的指南，event loop 应该在处理一个宏任务之后处理完微任务队列中的所有微任务。但是在版本低于 v11.0.0 的 NodeJS 中，微任务队列只有在 event loop 的两个阶段之间会被处理。

### The behavior of nested Timers

NodeJS 和浏览器之间以及各个不同的浏览器之间的 timers 的行为都不一样。Two of the most interesting facts of all are the behavior of timers with `0` timeout, and the behavior of nested timers.

需要注意的点是：

- 即使我们将 timeout 设为`0`，NodeJS 的 timers 都至少会在`1ms`之后触发。
- **Chrome** seems to cap the minimum timeout to `1ms` for the first 4 nested timers. But afterwards, the cap seems to be increased to `4ms`.
- Unlike Chrome, `Firefox` does not seem to cap the timeout for the first 4 timers. But similar to Chrome it caps the minimum timeout to `4ms` starting from the 5th nested timer.
- Safari doesn't seem to cap the timeout for the first 5 timers. But it introduces a `4ms` cap only from 6th nested timer onwards(unlike Chrome or Firefox).

那么这个针对 nested timers 的`4ms` cap 来自于哪里呢？

`4ms` cap for nested timers is actually described in the HTML standard. According to the standard:

> "Timers can be nested; after five such nested timers, however, the interval is forced to be at least four milliseconds."

According to this rule, this cap will be applied from the 5th nested timer onwards, as we observed with Chrome and Firefox. However, though the reason is not clear, Safari doesn't seem to be strictly following the rule because it applies the cap from 6th nested timer instead of from 5th.

> **Time to hack!** In Firefox, this cap is configurable using `dom.min_timeout_value` property in `about:config`. By default, this is set to `4ms` as per the HTML standard. Enjoying tweaking it and experimenting!

If we put the browsers aside for a moment and observe the results of Node, we can clearly see that Node doesn't seem to care about capping the timeout based on the nesting level. Instead, both Node, as well as Chrome, share another interesting behavior.

### Minimum timeout in all the timers in Node and Chrome

Both NodeJS and Chrome enforces a `1ms` minimum timeout to all the timers, even though they are not nested. But unlike Chrome, in NodeJS, this `1ms` delay is fixed regardless of the nesting level.

As you can see, different JavaScript runtimes have their own quirky implementations in terms of nested timers and timers with 0 timeouts. It’s important to keep this in mind when developing JavaScript applications/libraries and not strictly relying on runtime-specific behaviors for better compatibility.

### process.nextTick and setImmediate

另外一个 browsers 和 NodeJS 的不同点就是`process.nextTick`和`setImmediate`。

`process.nextTick` is strictly in NodeJS only and there's no browser counterpart for this API as of now. Although `nextTick` callbacks are not necessarily a part of NodeJS's libuv event loop, `nextTick` callbacks are executed as a consequence of NodeJS <u>crossing the C++/JS boundary</u> during the event loop. So it can be considered that it's related to the event loop in some way.

setImmediate is also a NodeJS-specific API. According to MDN and caniuse.com, setImmediate is available on IE 10, IE 11, and some earlier versions of Edge, and it’s unclear whether other browser vendors will implement this endpoint someday. However, as of this writing, it’s not a standard feature across all the browsers and shouldn’t be used in the browsers.
