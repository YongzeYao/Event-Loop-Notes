## Avoid sync I/O inside repeatedly invoked code blocks

在会被反复执行的代码块（例如循环）以及会被反复调用的函数中，要避免调用同步的 I/O 函数（`fs.readFileSync`，`fs.renameSync`等等）。
这样做会显著地降低你应用的性能，因为每次同步 I/O 请求执行的时候，event loop 都会阻塞直到该请求完成。
使用这些同步 I/O 函数的一个安全的地方就是在启动/初始化应用的时候读取配置文件。

## Functions should be completely async or completely sync

我们的应用包含了大大小小多个函数。而在一个 NodeJS 应用中，会有两种函数：

1. Synchronous Functions - Most of the time returns the outputs using `return` keyword (e.g, `Math` functions, `fs.readFileSync` etc.) or return te results/perform an operation (e.g, Array prototype functions such as `map`, `filter`, `reduce` etc.).
1. Asynchronous Functions - Returns the results deferred using a callback or a promise (e.g, `fs.readFile`, `dns.resolve` etc.)

而这里的规则就是，你所写的函数应该：

1. Completely synchronous - Behaves synchronously for all the inputs/conditions.
1. Completely asynchronous - Behave asynchronously for all the inputs/conditions.

If your function is a hybrid of the above two and behaves differently for different inputs/conditions, it may **result in unpredictable outcomes** of your applications.

## Too many nextTicks

尽管`process.nextTick`在很多情况下非常有用，递归地调用`process.nextTick`会造成 I/O starvation。因为这会导致 Node 一直递归地执行 nextTick 的回调而不会移动到 I/O phase。

## dns.lookup() vs. dns.resolve\*()

如果你看过 NodeJS 关于`dns`模块的文档，那么你应该会注意到`dns`模块提供了两个将 host name 解析为 IP 地址的方法。一个是`dns.lookup`，第二个是使用 dns 解析方法例如`dns.resolve4`以及`dns.resolve6`。尽管这两种方法看上去似乎没什么区别，它们内部的工作方式却截然不同。

`dns.lookup`的工作方式和`ping`指令口解析 hostname 的方法类似。它会调用操作系统 network API 的`getaddrinfo`函数。遗憾的是，这个函数并不是一个异步函数。所以为了 mimic the async behavior，libuv 线程池会调用`uv_getaddrinfo`函数。This could increase the contention for threads among other tasks which run on the threadpool and could result in a negative impact to the application's performance. 另外值得注意的是 libuv 线程池默认情况下只包含 4 个线程。因此，四个并行的`dns.lookup`调用将完全占据整个线程池，导致 starving 其他请求（file I/O, certain crypto function, possibly more dns lookups）。

相反的，`dsn.resolve()`以及其他`dns.resolve*()`的工作方式完全不同。官方文档是这样描述`dns.resolve*`的：

> These functions are implemented quite differently than <u>dns.lookup()</u>. They do not use <u>getaddrinfo</u> and they always perform a DNS query on the network. This network communication is always done asynchronously, and does not use libuv's threadpool.

NodeJS 使用了<u>c-ares</u>来提供`dns.resolve*()`相关功能。This library does not depend on libuv's threadpool and runs entirely on the network.

因为`dns.resolve`并不会使用线程池，所以一般情况下优先使用`dns.resolve`而不是`dns.lookup`除非我们需要 adhere to configuration files such as `/etc/nsswitch.conf`以及`/etc/hosts`。这些文件会在`getaddrinfo`的执行过程中被检索。

But there's an even bigger problem!

Let's say you are using NodeJS to make an HTTP request to `www.example.com`. First, it will resolve <u>`www.example`</u> into an IP address. Then it will use the resolved IP to set up the TCP connection **asynchronously**. So, sending an HTTP request is a **two-step** process.

Currently, both Node `http` and `https` modules internally use `dns.lookup` to resolve hostname to IP. During a failure of the DNS provider or a due to a higher network/dns latency, multiple http requests can easily keep the thread pool out-of-service for other requests. This has been a raised concern about `http` and `https`, but is still left as-is at the time fo this writing, in order to stick to the native OS behavior. Making things worse, many userland http client modules such as `request` also use `http` and `https` under the hood and are affected by this issue.

If you notice drastic performance drop in your application in terms of file I/O, crypto or any other threadpool-dependent task, there are few things you can do to improve your application's performance.

- You can increase the capacity of the threadpool up-to 128 threads by setting `UB_THREADPOOL_SIZE` environment variable.
- Resolve hostname to IP address using `dns.resolve*` function and use IP address directly.

## Concerns about the Threadpool

As we have seen throughout the series, libuv's threadpool is used for many purposes other than file I/O and can be a bottleneck for certain applications. If you think your application seems to slow down in terms of file I/O or crypto operations than usual, consider increasing the threadpool size by setting `UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE` env variable.

## Event loop monitoring

Monitoring the event loop for delays is crucial to prevent disruptions. This can also be leveraged to generate alerts, execute force restarts and scale up the service.

The easiest way to identify an event loop delay is by checking the additional time a timer takes to execute its callback. In simple terms, let's say we schedule a timer for 500 ms, if it took 550 ms to execute the timer's callback, we can deduce the event loop delays to be roughly 50 ms. This additional 50 ms should account for the time taken to execute events in other phases of the event loop. You don't need to write the above from scratch, instead, you can use <u>`loopbench`</u> module which implements the same logic to accomplish the event loop monitoring.
